## Environment Variables Setup

Before running the project, you need to set up the environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the following content:

```
XROAD_API_KEY= '' your xroad api key
OPENAI_API_KEY= '' your openai api key
```

Refer to the `.env.example` file, which contains the same content, to create your `.env` file.
